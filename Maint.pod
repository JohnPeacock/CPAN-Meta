The master source for the META spec is META-spec.pod.  META-spec.html
is built (manually) from META-spec.pod whenever there are changes, and
the two files should generally be checked in together.  Ideally it
would happen through a trigger or something, but it doesn't.

Ken has a cron job that copies the latest bleeding-edge version of the
spec (HTML version) to Sourceforge whenever his laptop is turned on:

  21 * * * * svn cat http://svn.perl.org/modules/Module-Build/trunk/website/META-spec.html \
       | ssh kwilliams@shell.sourceforge.net \
       'cat > /home/groups/m/mo/module-build/htdocs/META-spec-blead.html'

The numbered revisions of the spec at
L<"http://module-build.sourceforge.net/"> are captures of the spec at
opportune moments.  A couple of symlinks also exist for convenience:
